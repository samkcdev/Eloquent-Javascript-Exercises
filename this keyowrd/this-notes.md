Overview of this keyword in js

Different kinds of binding

Default-this will always point to window object
Implicit-this will take the object within which it is declared as its parent
Explicit- this explicitly setting the value for 'this' using call, bind and apply

There is something called new used in constructor function.

Need to expand these notes
