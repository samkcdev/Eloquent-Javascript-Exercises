    <h3>Exercise Questions</h3>
    1.What is the purpose of constructor function?

    <div>
      Sol: Purpose of constructor function is to act like a blueprint from which
      we can create new instances of an object using the properties used in the
      constructor function. eg:
      <pre>
          function Vehicle(make,type,year){
            this.make=make;
            this.type=type;
            this.year=year;
          }
        //Creating new object out this constructor
        let polo = new Vehicle("Volkswagon","Sedan",2000);
      </pre>
    </div>
    What does the new keyword do?

    <div>
      Sol:the <code>new</code> keyword does 4 things: <br />
      1:create a new object out the constructor; <br />
      2:sets the context of <code>this</code> keyword to the newly created
      object.<br />
      3:sets <code>return this</code> to the constructor function, so we dont
      have to write return in constructor function.<br />
      4:internal link is created between the object and the
      <code>.prototype</code> property on the constructor function. This link
      can be accessed by using __prototype__
    </div>

    <h3>Best practices for using constructor function</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Properties and methods which we dont want to be shared can go to
        constructor
      </li>
      <li>
        Properties and methods which we want to share can go to constructor. It
        is best to share methods in prototype.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Unless you have a good reason not to, always put function definitions on
      the constructor function's prototype.
